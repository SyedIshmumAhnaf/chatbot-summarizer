# AI Chat Log Summarizer

This is a Python command-line tool that summarizes chat logs between a user and an AI. 

The idea is to parse a `.txt` file formatted like a real conversation, extract messages, perform keyword analysis, and generate a readable summary.

Update 1:
The tool now has the ability to parse messages, differentiate messages between user and AI and also keeps count of the number of messages sent in total, sent by user and sent by AI respectively

ðŸš§ Currently under development â€” more features coming soon.
